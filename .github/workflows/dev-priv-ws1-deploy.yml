name: DEV-PRIVATE Workstation-1 Deploy

# This workflow runs on the CICD account's runners
# This EC2 build includes installing dependencies required for SIFT installation onto the EC2 then backgrounding the SIFT installation processes so they will run on the EC2 instance after the dependency
# installation is complete. This installation and build process takes ~50 minutes and can be monitored by listing running processes and grepping for "sift" in the process list.
# This installation uses known good versions of GoLang and SIFT for installation by targeting static versions to pull from websites.

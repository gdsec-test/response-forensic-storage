name: DEV ResponseStorage - Deploy

# Deploys the ResponseStorage main branch to the AWS DEV environment using sceptre.
# This workflow runs on a self-hosted runner

# Can only be deployed manually through workflow_dispatch - Select your branch while running. This will limit the
# amount of active IAM resources in the account which will minimize noise in the aws Slack channel.
# Deploy resources when dev resources are needed.
